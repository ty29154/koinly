# Koinly Review 2026: Save Hours on Crypto Taxes, Support 800+ Exchanges, Start Free

Tax season rolls around and suddenly everyone who traded crypto last year goes through the same five stages of grief. First denial ("I only made a few trades"). Then anger (spreadsheet hell). Then bargaining ("maybe the IRS won't notice"). Then depression (staring at 47 exchange export CSVs). Then finally — acceptance, and a search for software that just handles it.

That's basically how most people find Koinly. And once they do, a lot of them don't go back to spreadsheets.

Here's an honest look at what Koinly is, who it's for, and whether it's worth your money in 2026.

## What Is Koinly, Actually?

Koinly is crypto tax software. Built in 2018 by Robin Singh — who was apparently just as frustrated with manual crypto tracking as everyone else — it now has over a million users worldwide.

The core idea is simple: connect your wallets and exchanges, and Koinly pulls in all your transaction history automatically. It then figures out your capital gains, losses, income from staking or airdrops, and spits out a tax report formatted for your country. In the US that means IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D. In the UK it's HMRC-compatible reports. And so on for 100+ jurisdictions.

You don't need to touch a spreadsheet. You don't need to manually match transfers between your own wallets (Koinly does that automatically so you don't accidentally get taxed on moving your own coins). You just connect, review, and download.

## The Free Plan Is Actually Useful

Most "free" plans in software are just demos with a paywall two clicks in. Koinly's free tier is genuinely functional.

You can import up to 10,000 transactions, connect unlimited wallets and exchanges, view your full portfolio tracker, and see a real-time capital gains summary — all for free. The only thing locked behind a paid plan is downloading your actual tax reports.

This is worth emphasizing: you can import all your data, check whether the numbers look right, and verify accuracy before spending a cent. That's a pretty low-risk way to evaluate the platform.

## Pricing Plans: Which One Do You Need?

Koinly plans are priced per tax year, not as subscriptions. You pay once, generate unlimited reports for that year.

| Plan | Price | Transactions | Best For |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Free** | $0 forever | Up to 10,000 (preview only) | Portfolio tracking, no report download |
|  [**Newbie**](https://koinly.io/?via=516A6074&utm_source=friend) | **$49/tax year** | 100 | Casual holders, first-time filers |
|  [**Hodler**](https://koinly.io/?via=516A6074&utm_source=friend) | **$99/tax year** | 1,000 | Regular investors using a few exchanges |
|  [**Trader**](https://koinly.io/?via=516A6074&utm_source=friend) | **$179/tax year** | 3,000 | Active traders, DeFi users |
|  [**Pro**](https://koinly.io/?via=516A6074&utm_source=friend) | **$279/tax year** | 10,000 | Power users, day traders, professionals |

All paid plans include the same features — Form 8949, international tax reports, DeFi and NFT support, margin trade tracking, audit reports, TurboTax and TaxAct exports. The only variable is transaction volume.

One thing worth knowing: Koinly's transaction count is typically lower than you'd expect. The platform groups exchange fills from large orders into single transactions and filters out spam tokens and tiny dust rewards. So if you're sitting there thinking "I had 5,000 transactions last year," you might actually land in the Hodler tier just fine.

If you go over your plan's limit, you can upgrade by paying only the difference — you don't restart from scratch.

## What It Actually Does Well

**Import coverage is massive.** Koinly supports 800+ exchanges, wallets, and blockchains. Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Ledger, MetaMask, Uniswap, OpenSea — if you've used it, Koinly probably connects to it. You can import via API key, CSV upload, or just paste your public wallet address.

**DeFi and NFTs aren't an afterthought.** Staking rewards, liquidity pools, yield farming, NFT trades on EVM-compatible chains — Koinly handles these automatically. For Ethereum, Polygon, BSC, and other EVM networks, even NFT transactions get pulled in without manual entry.

**Smart transfer matching.** Moving ETH from your Coinbase account to your MetaMask wallet isn't a taxable event. Koinly knows this and matches internal transfers automatically, so you're not getting phantom gains on your own money moving between your own accounts.

**Tax loss harvesting tool.** Koinly scans your portfolio for unrealized losses you can use to offset gains. Useful if you're trying to reduce your tax bill before year-end.

**Works in 100+ countries.** If you're not in the US, Koinly still has you covered. It generates localized reports for Australia, Canada, UK, Germany, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and many more.

## A Few Things to Know

**No 2FA right now.** This is a real gap for a platform that handles sensitive financial data. Koinly uses read-only API connections (so it can never move your funds), and it's GDPR compliant with SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications. But the absence of two-factor authentication is worth noting until they add it.

**Pricing is per-year, not cumulative.** Your historical transactions count toward your limit. If you've been in crypto for a few years, your total transaction history might push you into a higher tier than your current-year trades alone would suggest.

**The top plan isn't unlimited.** At 10,000 transactions, the Pro plan covers most active traders. But if you genuinely need more, Koinly sells add-ons at $10 per 1,000 additional transactions, up to 100,000 total. Power users should account for this.

## What Real Users Say

The reviews across platforms are generally positive. A few representative takes from actual users:

*"The dashboard is incredibly intuitive. I'm not tech-savvy, but I managed to connect all my wallets and exchanges within minutes."* — Sarah M.

*"I trade across 12 different platforms, including some obscure DeFi protocols. Koinly handled everything — even my Uniswap V3 liquidity positions and NFT sales."* — David K.

*"As an accountant specializing in crypto, I've tested multiple tax software solutions. Koinly's calculation engine is rock-solid."* — Reviewer via GitHub

The main complaints are around pricing feeling steep for high-volume traders, and occasional edge cases with newer or more obscure chains.

## Discounts and Promo Codes

Koinly's referral program gives 25% off your plan when a friend signs up and purchases through your link. Seasonal promotions — particularly around Black Friday and tax season — can go up to 40% off. Coupon sites occasionally list codes with reported savings in the 20–30% range, though availability varies.

Only one discount can be applied per order, so pick the best one if you find multiple options.

## Is It Worth It?

For most crypto investors, yes. The time Koinly saves versus manually tracking everything across multiple wallets and exchanges is easily worth $49–$99. For active traders, the accuracy alone justifies the cost — the last thing you want is an audit because your manually compiled spreadsheet had an error.

The free plan is the right starting point. Import everything, check the numbers, and then pay only if you're happy with what you see.
